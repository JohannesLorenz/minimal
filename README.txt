1 What is minimal?
::::::::::::::::::

2 Why using minimal?
::::::::::::::::::::

The author loved lmms, but still found many things unpractical. minimal fixes
some of those:

 * The use of windows VSTs in lmms makes many shared files useless for linux
   users. Thus, minimal forbids VSTs.
 * The lmms main developpers often do not respond per mail. The minimal main
   developper always responds fast.
 * You can easily add a license to your songs. In LMMS, you had to edit the
   XML file to be sure.
 * The effects in LMMS were hard to overview. In minimal, you don't only have
   an overview in your code, but also can dump an effect graph.
 * In LMMS, you could not use the same instrument in multiple tracks. In
   minimal, this will be possible. Thus, you will save loading times.
 * LMMS takes long to compile and to start. minimal is minimal and thus is way
   faster in compiling and instant in startup.
 * LMMS project files are huge compared to those of minimal.
 * LMMS is not real time compatible, minimal is (hopefully).
 * LMMS can not be used (completely) without a GUI.
 * LMMS does not have macros for its UI. With minimal, you can write a script
   or a C++ program that does what you like.
 * LMMS is not generally RTOSC compatible. minimal lets you simply write
   plugins.
 * The LMMS developpers care about compatibility with old compilers. This
   restricts the code to old versions of C++. In minimal, coders can use new
   versions of C++.
