1 What is minimal?
::::::::::::::::::

2 Why using minimal?
::::::::::::::::::::

The author liked lmms, but still found many things unpractical. minimal fixes
some of those:

 * Fast support times for developping issues.
 * You can easily add a license to your projects, since they are in plain
   text.
 * In minimal, you have a clear overview on your effects. You can even dump an
   effect graph.
 * minimal is designed for instant compiling and startup.
 * the project files in minimal have minimal size.
 * minimal is (hopefully) RT compatible.
 * minimal can be used without any x server.
 * minimal lets you easily write plugins for any OSC plugin.
 * In minimal, coders can use new versions of C++.
 * minimal forbids code that runs only on Windows. It supports open souce.
