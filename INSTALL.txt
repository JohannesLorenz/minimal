0 Requirements
::::::::::::::

You will need the following libraries, headers and tools:

  * at least g++ 4.8 or clang 3.3
  * boost
  * cmake
  * zynaddsubfx, a version from at least April 2015 (TODO: make optional)

1 Installation of the commandline interface
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The initial installation and updating are different processes.

For the initial installation, type in this directory:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  
  mkdir build
  cd build
  # for a release build using clang (suggested), where /path/to/zynaddsubfx is
  # the binary executable for zynaddsubfx
  cmake	-DCOMPILER=clang \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	-DZYN_BINARY=/path/to/zynaddsubfx \
	..

In order to update the code, go to the main directory and type

  ./update

2 Running
:::::::::

You can try playing a song now. Be careful to set the volume to as loud as it
usually is when you use zynaddsubfx.

  ./src/core/minimal ./src/songs/libdemo.so
