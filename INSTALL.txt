1 Installation
::::::::::::::

The initial installation and updating are different processes.

For the initial installation, type in this directory:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  
  mkdir build
  cd build
  # for a release build using clang (suggested), where /path/to/zynaddsubfx is
  # the binary executable for zynaddsubfx
  cmake	-DCOMPILER=clang \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	-DZYN_BINARY=/path/to/zynaddsubfx \
	..

In order to update the code, go to the main directory and type

  ./update

2 Realtime check with stoat
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Make sure stoat is (root-)installed on your disk.

Instead of using the cmake code from above, use

  cmake -DCOMPILER=stoat ..

Then, run

  make stoat.

The output should prompt a total of 0 errors.

3 Running
:::::::::

You can try playing a song now. Be careful to set the volume to as loud as it
usually is when you use zynaddsubfx.

  ./src/core/minimal ./src/songs/libdemo.so
