# 1 What is minimal?
It is basically an **RT compatible, text based sequencer**. It supports **OSC**.

The project files are C++ code, which is very easy to generate with a suited
C++ editor.

In the future, you will be able to create music, videos, computer games,
mathematical graphics etc.

# 2 Why using minimal?
A few benefits from using minimal:
  * **Good support** for developping issues.
  * You can easily **license your projects**, since they are in plain text.
  * In minimal, you have a clear overview on your effects. You can even dump
    an **effect graph**.
  * minimal is designed for **instant compiling and startup**.
  * **short and human readable project files**
  * minimal is (assumably) **RT compatible**.
  * minimal can be used **without any X server**.
  * minimal lets you **easily write plugins**, e.g. for any **OSC** plugin.
  * In minimal, coders can use **C++11**.
  * minimal supports **open souce** and has **no windows only plugins**.
