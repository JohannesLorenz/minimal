# 1 What is minimal?
It is basically an RT compatible, text based sequencer. It supports OSC.

The project files are C++ code, which is very easy to generate with a suited
C++ editor.

In the future, you will be able to create music, videos, computer games,
mathematical graphics etc.

# 2 Why using minimal?
A few benefits from using minimal:
  * Fast support times for developping issues.
  * You can easily add a license to your projects, since they are in plain
    text.
  * In minimal, you have a clear overview on your effects. You can even dump
    an effect graph.
  * minimal is designed for instant compiling and startup.
  * the project files in minimal have minimal size.
  * minimal is (hopefully) RT compatible.
  * minimal can be used without any x server.
  * minimal lets you easily write plugins for any OSC plugin.
  * In minimal, coders can use new versions of C++.
  * minimal forbids code that runs only on Windows. It supports open souce.
